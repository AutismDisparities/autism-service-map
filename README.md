# autism-service-map
The map was conceived and designed to help people in Georgia navigate and coordinate autism services. Additionally, it provides an educational tool for those learning about the relationship between structural inequities and location of autism services across the state of Georgia.

This project was funded through a grant from the [Digital Integrative Liberal Arts Center](https://dilac.iac.gatech.edu/) at the Georgia Tech Ivan Allen College of Liberal Arts.
